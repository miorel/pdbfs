Introduction
------------
The RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB), accessible at <http://www.pdb.org/>, is an
excellent repository of protein structures determined by X-ray
crystallography, which has yet to be used to its full potential.

pdbfs hopes to facilitate the writing of tools to data-mine the PDB by 
making it possible to mount the PDB as a filesystem. This package concerns
itself with getting a list of structures and on the fly downloading and 
decompressing the proper files, so that other packages don't have to!

Prerequisite
------------
This package depends on the FUSE project, obtainable from
<http://fuse.sourceforge.net/>.

Installation Summary
--------------------
The usual `./configure; make; make install' should be sufficient to install
this package. To learn more than you ever wanted to know about how you can
tweak the installation, take a look at the output of `./configure --help'.
If you don't have administrator privileges, you will be especially interested
in the `--prefix' option, which allows you to customize the installation
directory.
