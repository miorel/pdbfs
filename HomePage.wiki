=Introduction=

The [http://www.pdb.org/ Protein Data Bank] (PDB) is an excellent repository of protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography, which has yet to be used to its full potential.

pdbfs hopes to facilitate the writing of tools to data-mine the PDB by making it possible to mount the PDB as a filesystem. This package concerns itself with getting a list of structures and on the fly downloading and decompressing the proper files, so that other packages don't have to!

=Prerequisites=
  * build tools: gcc, make, etc.; on Ubuntu, get these with `sudo apt-get install build-essential`; on Gentoo, it's part of the system set
  * rsync command; on Ubuntu, it should be installed by default, or you can `sudo apt-get install rsync`; on Gentoo, it's part of the system set

=Synopsis=
  * download the latest source
{{{
wget http://pdbfs.googlecode.com/files/pdbfs-0.0.3.tar.gz
}}}
  * unpack the archive and change into the newly-created directory
{{{
tar xvzf pdbfs-*.tar.gz
cd pdbfs-*
}}}
  * configure, make, and install
{{{
./configure
make
sudo make install
}}}
  * mount the filesystem
{{{
sudo pdbfs -oallow_other,attr_timeout=0 /mnt/pdb
}}}
  * view a structure (it will be downloaded on the fly the first time you access it!)
{{{
pymol /mnt/pdb/2cba.pdb
}}}
  * unmount the filesystem
{{{
sudo umount /mnt/pdb
}}}
